----
29 October 2012: Changed functions strip_padding and find_genre
to optimize code
This new features reduced dramatically len and lower calls 
giving a better response time on the library

Changes made by: Carlos Zager <czager@zava.com.ve>

v1.2
----

5 April 2002: New dictionary-based interface, compatible with
ogg.vorbis module.

Default genre will be 255 if not specified, not 0 ("Blues").

Rewrote id3-tagger.py to use new dictionary-based interface
(simplifies code a lot).

v1.1
----

23 December 2000: Overload the ID3 constructor to allow passing in
either a filename *or* an already-opened file along with a filename.

Make sure we open the file in r+b mode if we're given a filename,
to make Windows (and VMS? *grin*) folks happy.

No longer repeatedly opens/closes files; instead just opens in r+b
mode right at the beginning and does flush() if necessary to make sure
we have the old functionality.

Changed example id3-tagger.py to properly do an explicit ID3.write()
call if something's changed, to catch and print exceptions nicely.

v1.0
----

21 September 2000: First 1.0 release. Add ID3 v1.1 support (the last
byte of the Comments field is considered to be a track number if the
previous byte is non-null).

Add whitespace/null stripping to the end of all fields. If this breaks
anything, please let me know! I shouldn't assume this, but I figure
it'd be nice for folks not to have to do this on their own. I'll take
it out if it causes problems.

Write a README, COPYING, CHANGES file, and add a setup.py for
Distutils and Python 1.6 users.

v0.6
----

11 June 1999: Fix from Arne Zellentin (arne@unix-ag.org) to prevent
wiping out the last 128 bytes of MP3 files that don't already have an
ID3 tag. Oops!


0.5
---

2 May 1999: Initial release.
